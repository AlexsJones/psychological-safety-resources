# The what

Psychological safety is being able to show and employ one's self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or career. It can be defined as a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. In psychologically safe teams, team members feel accepted and respected.


“Psychological safety is a belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes” – Amy Edmondson
# The why

In [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP6guvRt0U0) talk by Amy Edmonson she summarizes the need for safety not only in our personal lives but at work - it’s only a few minutes long and easy to consume.

Her academic article is [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2666999)


In addition to this, the resource ["Good leaders make you feel good"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?

) by Simon Sinek, management theory is excellent.

## Resources

[Psychological safety action pack](https://psychsafety.co.uk/asp-products/psychological-safety-action-pack/)

_It is also worth looking at the main part of the website_  [pscyhsafety](https://www.psychsafety.co.uk/)

_This toolkit is a pack of infographics and sheets that provide simple to consume and easily understandable checks for making a safety net at work and in life._

[High performing teams need psychological safety heres how to create it](https://hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it)

_The HBR distills alot of the principals laid out by Amy and offers some formulaic approach to encouraging safety_

_I like this one, it’s simple enough to read it once and get something out of it._

[What is pyschological safety at work](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/what-is-psychological-safety-at-work/)

_One of the best things about this article is the identification of both passive and active negative behaviours. Also they have a cool infographic_
